Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field.  It navigates the intersection between biology,
programming, and mathematics.  Today let's play with DNA.

DNA is the building block of human life.  It is a double strand of four nucleotides called adenine,
cytosine, guanine, and thymine that encodes our genetic instructions.  We can represent the famous
DNA double helix with a text file containing a very long list of letters: A (adenine), C (cytosine),
G (guanine), and T (thymine).

There is a file called genome.txt.  Write a program that:

a.	opens genome.txt
b.	calculates the total length of the DNA strand (the number of characters)
c.	calculates the percentage of A, C, G, and T nucleotides in the DNA strand
d.	calculates the length of the longest sequence of G in the DNA strand
e.  calculates the number of times the sequence CAT appears in the DNA strand (meow)
e.	creates a new file called exam.txt to store these statistics. The exam.txt file must contain
three lines of information where XX are either integers or floating point numbers as appropriate:

    The total length of the DNA strand is XX characters.
    The percentages of A, C, G, and T are XX.XX, XX.XX, XX.XX, and XX.XX.
    The longest sequence of Gs in the DNA strand is composed of XX Gs.
    The sequence CAT appears in the DNA strand XX times.

No documentation or testing is required.

This will be graded out of 6.
