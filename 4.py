"""
The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution
cipher in which each letter in a plaintext message is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the
alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

One way to make a Caesar cipher a bit harder to break is to use different shifts at different
positions in the message. For example, we could shift the first character by 5, the second by 12,
the third by 7, and the fourth by 20. Then we repeat the pattern, shifting the fifth character by 5,
the sixth by 12, and so on, until we reach the end of the message we are encrypting.

Such a scheme is called a Vigen√®re cipher and it is about 400 years old.

Implement a function called vigenere which accepts the name of a plaintext file (a string), and
a non-empty tuple of positive integers that are all in the range [0, 25].

The vigenere function must open the file for reading only. If the file does not exist, raise
a suitable exception that contains a suitable message, and end the program gracefully.

If the file does exist, you must encrypt the message in the file using the Vigenere cipher.

The vigenere function must store the encrypted message in a new file whose name is
the original file appended with _shifted. For example, passing the file 'message' to the
vigenere function will encode the text in message and write it to a file called 'message_shifted'.

No documentation or testing is required.

This will be graded out of 6.
